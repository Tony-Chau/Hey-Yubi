# Yubi
<p>This project was made in UIPath, Python, Visual Studio (.NET) using C# language, Visual Basic and mysql. Custom Activity was used and nuget packages were self made with the exception of Python. Only the Youtube API was used.</p>

<p> This Youtube AI program uses voice recognition to search videos and plays them. This project was made for fun and was not intended to be a useful.</p>

<p> Please download UiPath Robot to test this AI. This is just the alpha version and working on other projects right now. Will upload a video soon.</p>
