# Yubi
<p>This project was made in UIPath, Python, Visual Studio (.NET) using C# language, Visual Basic (showing thumbnails) and mysql. Custom Activity was used and nuget packages were self made with the exception of Python. Only the Youtube API was used.</p>

<p> This Youtube RPA program uses voice recognition to search videos and plays them.</p>

<p> Please download UiPath Robot to test this program.</p>
