# Yubi
<h4><strong>The work is still in progress.</strong></h4> 
<p>This project was made in UIPath, Python, Visual Studio (.NET) using C# language, Visual Basic and mysql. Custom Activity was used and nuget packages were self made with the exception of Python. Only the Youtube API was used.</p>

<p> This Youtube AI program uses voice recognition to search videos for you and shows them to you directly. The work is still in testing phase at the moment, which means the search phase was skipped to save time</p>
<p> A short version of this AI will be created soon. Once this is completed of course. </p>
<p> The project will be deployed once it is completed and a link will be provided. Please download Uipath Robot. This project is now completed, but needs to be tested to make it fully functional. </p>
