# Yubi
<p>This project was made in UIPath, Python, Visual Studio (.NET) using C# language, Visual Basic (showing thumbnails) and mysql. Custom Activity was used and nuget packages were self made with the exception of Python. Only the Youtube API was used. This Youtube RPA program uses voice recognition to search videos and plays them.</p>
